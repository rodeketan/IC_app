# Image Captioner
## This app generates  an accurate caption to any input image using Recurrent Neural Network. 
- We have utilised a pre-trained InceptionV3 model to encode the Flickr8k data set input images. 
- Dataset consisted of 8000 images with 5 captions for each image.
- Carried out extensive exploratory data analysis on the data (images, and captions).
- Fed the encoded images to an RNN and used GLOVE model for vectorization of words.
